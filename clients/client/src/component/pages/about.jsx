            <h1 className='about-h'>About Affordable Rides</h1>
            <p className='about-p'> Affordable rides  is an app that connect passengers and local drivers using their personal vehicles.In most cases they are a comfortable method for door-to-door transport.</p>
            <p className='about-p'>Professional Service
Drivers for affordable rides and its competitors use their own cars, and they seem incentivized to keep them clean and well-maintained. The cheapest options are late-model compacts, not junkers.

The riders input their destinations into the app, and the drivers use navigational software to get there. Wrong turns are unlikely.

The drivers are generally polite and well-spoken. They never refuse to take you to any particular destination. They don't even know your destination before they accept your call.

Does this sound like a case of damning with faint praise? That depends on what city or cities you were accustomed to catching taxis in.

Unprofessional drivers are weeded out because passengers get to rate the driverâ€™s performance. A consistently low rating will force a driver out of affordable rides or its competitors. 

All of the above and more foster a positive experience for ride-sharing customers.</p>
{/* <p className='about-p'>Convenient and Cashless
Instead of chasing down a taxi on a street, or calling and waiting for a car service, e-hail app users can hail a car from any location and have it arrive in minutes. Affordable Rides doesn't even need to ask you for an address. It knows where you are.

Because the passenger's credit card is linked to the e-hail account, no cash changes hands. At the destination, the driver stops the car and the passenger gets out and walks away. A receipt is sent via email, with links to options for rating and tipping the driver.</p> */}


{/* <p>Competitive Pricing */}
{/* It is impossible to come up with a definitive or average price for an Affordable Rides. Its pricing scheme varies with every city, and that surge pricing model changes the prices constantly based on demand.


According to Consumer Reports, longer trips are generally cheaper by Affordable Rides but short trips can be more expensive. And the vast majority of trips by Affordable Rides are short.

 So, an Affordable Rides ride from the airport to a suburb should save you money, but a mile-long trip across a neighborhood could well be cheaper in a cab and would definitely be cheaper by bus or subway.

Consumer Reports also warns that the surge pricing model for both Affordable Rides and Lyft can mean much higher prices at busy times of the day.


The bottom line: Affordable Rides can be less expensive than a taxi or car service, but not consistently. One point in its favor, though, is that Affordable Rides tells you exactly what the prices will be for the options available at that time before you confirm the trip.</p> */}
